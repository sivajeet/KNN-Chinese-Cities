# KNN-Chinese-Cities

Implementing a k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) classifier. The file Cities.zip contains a dataset of weather, climate and pollution measurements from five Chinese cities. The target variable is called "PM_HIGH" and represents the event that the pollution level, measured as a concentration of particles called PM2.5, is higher than 100 ug/m^3. Applying the classifier to the Chinese city pollution dataset, by predicting the binary target variable PM_HIGH
